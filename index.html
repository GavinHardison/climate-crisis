            <h1 id="title">California Wildfires</h1>
            <p id="description">California&apos;s wildfires have become one of the clearest examples of how climate change intensifies natural disasters. As temperatures rise and droughts become more severe, the state&apos;s forests and grasslands dry out, creating perfect conditions for massive, fast-moving fires. Hotter weather also leads to earlier snowmelt and longer dry seasons, leaving vegetation tinder-dry for much of the year. Combined with strong winds and expanding development into wildland areas, these conditions have made wildfires larger, more destructive, and harder to control. Scientists warn that unless greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and forest management practices are improved, California will continue to face longer and more catastrophic fire seasons in the decades ahead.</p>

                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="fact-info-1">California&apos;s wildfire season typically runs from May through October, though fires can now occur year-round due to changing climate conditions.</p>
                <p class="fact-info-2">In the past, the rainy winter months helped limit fires to the summer and early fall. However, recent droughts and higher average temperatures have dried out vegetation even during winter, creating fuel for fires at any time of year. This shift means firefighting agencies must remain on alert year-round rather than for just a few months.</p>

                <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
                <p class="fact-info-1">Around 90% of wildfires in California are caused by human activity, including power lines, vehicles, and campfires.</p>
                <p class="fact-info-2">Accidents, negligence, and sometimes arson contribute to most wildfire ignitions. Utility equipment failures, such as those linked to PG&E, have sparked several of the state&apos;s most destructive fires. Public awareness campaigns now focus on “fire-safe” behavior to reduce human-caused incidents.</p>

                <p class="fact-info-1">The Camp Fire (2018) is California&apos;s costliest and deadliest wildfire, causing over $16.5 billion in damage and claiming 85 lives.</p>
                <p class="fact-info-2">The Camp Fire devastated the town of Paradise in Northern California, destroying nearly 19,000 buildings in just a few hours. Sparked by faulty power lines, it forced tens of thousands to evacuate and became a grim symbol of how quickly wind-driven fires can destroy entire communities.</p>

                <p class="fact-info-2">Climate change contributes to longer dry spells, reduced snowpack, and earlier snowmelt — all of which dry out forests and grasslands. When combined with high winds and low humidity, these conditions create ideal circumstances for fast-spreading and uncontrollable wildfires.</p>

                <p class="fact-info-2">Beyond immediate destruction, wildfires have long-term economic effects. Recovery and rebuilding can take years, and smoke-related health problems increase medical expenses. Insurance companies have even withdrawn coverage from high-risk areas, driving up costs for residents and businesses.</p>

                <p class="fact-info-1">Despite their danger, wildfires play a natural role in regenerating ecosystems, clearing dead vegetation and promoting new plant growth in many California forests.</p>
                <p class="fact-info-2">Some species, such as certain pine trees, actually depend on fire to release their seeds. Fire also clears overgrown brush, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor and new plants to thrive. However, increasingly intense and frequent fires can damage soil and prevent recovery, disrupting this natural balance.</p>
